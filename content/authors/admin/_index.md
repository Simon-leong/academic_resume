Greetings! I am Qifan Liang, a current undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Technology at Wuhan University, and also a lab member of the National Multimedia Software Engineering Technology Research Center at Wuhan University. Fortunately, I have conducted computer vision research under Prof. Jens Rittscher at Oxford University, Prof. Zhen Han and Prof. Kaimin Sun at Wuhan University. In addition, I have been the technological leader of the National Entrepreneurial Research Program for Undergraduates and National Innovative Research Program for Undergraduates in the State Key Laboratory of Surveying and Mapping and Remote Sensing of Wuhan University.

My research interests :
  (1) Fundamentals and applications of deep learning algorithms, and design of training strategies for few-shot scenarios.
  (2) Exploring the recovery of visually distorted elements (smoke, haze) in dynamic environments, especially in the medical field.
  (3) Human-centered visual perception and 2D/3D scene understanding.
