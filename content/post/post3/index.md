## Overview

We all know that there is a gap between theoretical research and practical application in the field of trajectory prediction. Although this is a broad semantic background, countless researchers share the ultimate goal of ensuring the safety of autonomous driving in various scenarios. In the context of data-driven research, we have been striving to obtain more and better real-world driving data. However, the high costs of data collection and manual annotation mean that the data can never fully meet our requirements for generalization in traffic scenarios. We found that in daily driving, most vehicles usually maintain normal behavior, and the collected training data often contains a large number of normal trajectory samples. However, based on the goal of safety, we hope that real trajectory prediction can robustly adapt to all possible sudden situations. Collision data in scenarios where trajectories overlap in multi-lane intersections, busy pedestrian areas, and sudden lane changes of vehicles constitute the long-tail samples in our dataset. We believe that this kind of few-shot data is critical to improving the safety adaptability of our prediction models and is also an indispensable consideration for achieving intelligence in Level 5 autonomous driving.

Faced with these long-tail samples that imply safety crises, we must pose several questions: How can we obtain such few-shot bias data in the dataset? How can we construct a fair few-shot experimental environment based on this data? Do we really need to unilaterally reduce the excellent predictive performance that large-sample data provides to target these special samples? And how should we adapt to the scenario diversity of these long-tail samples?
 
To address the above questions, we aimed to design a model-agnostic trajectory prediction enhancement strategy consisting of three parts: identification principles, guiding principles, and training principles. Based on safety orientation, **we use identification principles to find collision long-tail samples in the dataset, and use these long-tail samples as triggers to construct a few-shot learning environment, and finally employ Scenario-Aware Meta-Learning to give the model stronger safety adaptability**. Meanwhile, we believe that scaling law can help us find a balance between safety adaptability and predictive ability. Therefore, we use scaling law as the augmentation guiding principle of the baseline model and conducted a series of experiments in few-shot context to explore the new possibilities brought by large data and large parameters to trajectory prediction.
