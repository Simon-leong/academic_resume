## Overview

Smoke is a common visual distortion element that has important applications in endoscopic surgery. Smoke generated by surgical cauterization can severely interfere with the visual field, affecting the progress of the procedure to the point where it can lead to a serious risk to life. However, all previous studies on smoke removal only consider smoke as a continuous fluid and use a unified framework to process it, which seriously neglects the two semantic information of smoke-the starting point and the diffusion direction, while all existing smoke removal algorithms do not consider the temporal features and process each frame of the image in a segmented way, which loses the continuous information of smoke. **Based on the above observations, we will publicly provide for the first smoke/smoke-free video dataset synthesized by the blender 3d engine, and propose a video de-smoking framework based on a smoke temporal classification strategy, where semantic segmentation and storage-optimizational cross-attention are introduced to learn the complex motion patterns of overlapping smoke.**
